A Python-based Smart Parking System designed to streamline parking operations, optimize space utilization, and enhance user experience. This project provides an efficient way to manage parking spaces, handle reservations, calculate charges, and track vehicle entries/exits in real-time.



Functionalities provided by Parking System are as follows:

+ Provides the searching facilities based on various factors .Such
as Parking Slots , Parking fees, duration.
+ It tracks the information of vehicles.
+ Editing , adding and updating of records is improved ,which
results in proper resource management of duration data.
+ To increase efficiency of managing the data .
Future Scope of this project:
+ We can add printers in the future.
+ We will host the platform on online servers to make it accessible
worldwide.
Database Systems: The system can be implemented on Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL databases, providing a reliable and scalable foundation for managing parking operations.

Guidance: This project was developed under the guidance of Sir Anirudha Gaikwad.
